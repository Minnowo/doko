# Imylib2

Imylib2 is a wrapper around Imlib2 for Immy.

Instead of writing code to read a bunch of image formats, it is much easier to use Imlib2 which has already done the work.
Imylib2 takes the loaders from Imlib2 and builds them statically to include directly in Immy, without the extra stuff provided by Imlib2.
